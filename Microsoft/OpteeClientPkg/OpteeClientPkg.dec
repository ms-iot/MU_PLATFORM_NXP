  # OPTEE expects the TA UUIDs to have its first 3 fields in big-endian format while
  # the other fields are in little-endian. However, will store them in the UEFI
  # image in their EFI_GUID format in which all fields are little-endian. It is
  # the responsibility of the UEFI TEEC (aka OpteeClientApiLib) to convert the
  # endianess of the UUIDs to match OPTEE expectations before send them off.
