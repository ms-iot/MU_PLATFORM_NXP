# FD Section
# The [FD] Section is made up of the definition statements and a
# description of what goes into  the Flash Device Image.  Each FD section
# defines one flash "device" image.  A flash device image may be one of
# the following: Removable media bootable image (like a boot floppy
# image,) an Option ROM image (that would be "flashed" into an add-in
# card,) a System "Flash"  image (that would be burned into a system's
# flash) or an Update ("Capsule") image that will be used to update and
# existing system flash.

# Following are lists of FD Region layout which correspond to the locations of different
# images within the flash device.
#
# Regions must be defined in ascending order and may not overlap.
#
# A Layout Region start with a eight digit hex offset (leading "0x" required) followed by
# the pipe "|" character, followed by the size of the region, also in hex with the leading
# "0x" characters. Like:
# Offset|Size
# PcdOffsetCName|PcdSizeCName
# RegionType <FV, DATA, or FILE>

# [FV] section is used to define what components or modules are placed within a flash
